# Mobile nav only with CSS

This is a simple example of a mobile navigation menu that is only visible on mobile devices. It uses only CSS and no JavaScript.

## How it works

By using `@starting-style` and `popover` built into the browser, we can create a mobile navigation menu that is only visible on mobile devices. The menu is hidden on desktops and tablets.
