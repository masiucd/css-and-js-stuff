# Toggle switch with only CSS

This is a simple toggle switch that I made using only CSS. It is a simple and clean design that can be used in any project. The switch is fully responsive and can be used in any screen size.

We springing in some Javascript just to switch from light to dark mode.

By using the `:checked` pseudo-class, we can change the style of the switch when it is toggled on. This allows us to create a simple and clean design that is easy to use and understand.
